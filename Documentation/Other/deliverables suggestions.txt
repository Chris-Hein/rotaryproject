My suggestions for deliverables (listed as sprints as thats what they'll translate into within jira)
the concept behind my deliverable ideas is based on developing the components the pages will use first (such as the account system, the internal message system, invoice page, profile system, etc...) and then incorporating them into the main pages. so they're a bit modular

NOTE: on the admin page side of things i'm thinking we either design separate pages for each major function (say main page, approval of images, admin functions, reports, etc..) or simply have one main admin page with a design and functionality to support the ability to open hidden divs containing these features at will to access whatever the user wants without the need to develop multiple separate pages. in that case the deliverables listed would go from being separate pages to features within one page to be implemented

- developing the front end visual template for the team to use for the site, to keep things consistant

- redesigning and rebuilding the database to support the changes we will be making

- incorporating password reset feature on login page

- implement profile feature into the user accounts : includes profile editing with important info, feedback page, invoice history page and would be fairly simple in terms of functionality

- develop main back end admin page (allows such things as manual password reset, sending admin messages, viewing client reports, sending mass email announcement alerts)

- develop internal mail page (site based internal mail page, self explanatory)

- develop reports page (would allow for display of information related to the clients in an easy to choose and view manner and in a format that lends itself well to make developing external reports easier for the user, would also include search feature to get info based on contact info, business name, activity reports, financial reports etc..)

- develop ad approval system that allows users to submit an ad and the admin to approve/deny the ad (and give feedback to user if necessary as to why it was rejected) prior to being finalized and the user invoiced

- develop automated invoice system

- implement feature for testing for emails that are invalid

- implement small ad system that the rotary club can use to upload an image of their own and some text that will be displayed as an ad on the site pages for events and such

- develop the sponsor page functionality

- develop the photographer page, potentially include the ability to see necessary details of clients ad purchase to make their job easier (such as what size of ad, time and place of meeting to take pictures, etc..)

- develop the solicitor/client page (also, needs new name for page)

- develop a general feedback page accessible to everyone

- rewrite login system to eliminate ajax and to tie into profile system

- implement client feature to select (and see simple example of via some small page image) the size of the ad they want to buy
